API - application program interface
    - consuming api means we hit certain parts of API where theres info & bring that info into our own app
    - help save us code, reusing existing code and faster for optimizing our app
Directory: Project folder, belongs on computer - documentation
Cloud: Github, repository, push project into so available online

1. Build CLI
2. Welcome user, prompt to either select a list, or tell exit if want (1 interaction)
3. if they select list, print the list of breweries
    1. brewery name etc.

*Prompt user to select something twice, and print out something based on those selections

What will your app do?

What is the user experience?

Where will you get your data from?

https://www.openbrewerydb.org/
    https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries
What will you need to do with the data once you've got it?

What classes will you be using?
    3 classes: (separation of responsibilities)
    CLI - controller - communicates with my user
    brewery - where objects are created & stored for user display
    API - bring in external data, consume api here & instantiate my objects

How will you display data one level deep to the user?
