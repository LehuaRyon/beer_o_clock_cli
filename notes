Project Requirements:

- Provide a CLI (Links to an external site.)
- Your CLI application (Links to an external site.) must provide access to data from a web page.
- The data provided must go at least one level deep. A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice.
- Your CLI application should not be too similar to the Ruby final projects (Music Library CLI, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI, Student Scraper). Also, please refrain from using Kickstarter (Links to an external site.) as that was used for the scraping 'code along'.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should be creating a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. Pro Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page - utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!

What will your app do?
    My application goes two levels deep:
    1. Prompts the user to enter a number to receive a list of breweries or exit.
    2. Once the list appears, the user is prompted to either enter a brewery name to find out more details about that brewery or exit
    3. Brewery details print out and the user is prompted once again to see the brewery list to find out details about another brewery or exit

What is the user experience?
    1. Welcome the user
    2. Prompt user to input his/her name or exit
    3. Prompt user to input a number to either see all CA breweries or exit
    4. Display the most breweries possible alphabetically
    5. Prompt user to input a brewery name to see its details or exit
    5. Display name, brewery type, location, phone number, and website
    6. Prompt user to input a number either to see all CA breweries again to look at another brewery's details or exit

Where will you get your data from?
    API Base URL: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/
    Description: A collection of open breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops in the United States
    Extension: https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_state=california&per_page=50
        This link shows only 50 (that's the max able to be shown) CA breweries in alphabetical order

What will you need to do with the data once you've got it?
    - Instantiate new brewery objects with selected attributes & save those objects in @@all array
        - List all breweries in numbered list with name and state
        - Find a brewery object by its name
        - List values of each key for each attribute of a brewery when brewery name is chosen

What classes will you be using?
    3 classes: (separation of responsibilities)
    CLI - controller - communicates with my user
    Brewery - objects - where objects are created & stored for user display
    API - gets data - brings in external data, consume api, instantiate my objects

How will you display data one level deep to the user?
    1st Level: List of CA breweries
    2nd Level: Details of a specific CA brewery



run:
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
    - shebang line (need in any file using ruby code, but not telling the file you're a ruby file with .rb)
        - tells environment its not ruby file
        - but going to be using ruby code
        - so load into environment
    - lets the user run the cli on any version of ruby they have on their computer
    - point of entry, the "door" to my app

require_relative '../lib/environment.rb'

CLI.new.run
    - new session, starting a new instance of CLI class & invoke run method in it
    - done session, close/delete instance of CLI



environment.rb:
require "bundler"
Bundler.require
    - dont need anymore:
    - require "pry"
    - require "rest-client"
    - require "json"
    - require "rainbow"
    - require "tty-prompt"
    - require "require_all"

require_all './lib/beer_o_clock_cli'
    don't need anymore:
    - require_relative "./beer_o_clock_cli/api.rb/
    - require_relative "./beer_o_clock_cli/cli.rb/
    - require_relative "./beer_o_clock_cli/brewery.rb/



api.rb:
class API (application program interface)
    - consuming api means we hit certain parts of the API where there's info & bring that info into our own app
    - help save us code, reusing code & faster for optimizing app
    def self.get_data
        response = RestClient.get("https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_state=california&per_page=50")
            - call out to external API endpoint to consume all breweries, submit request to get data
        breweries_array = JSON.parse(response).each{|brewery| Brewery.new(brewery)}
            - use JSON to parse response's string body (things over internet communicate in strings, not hashes & arrays)
            - the return value is array stored in breweries_array
            - instantiate a new brewery ruby objects with each brewery from array
            - above, brewery= hash of attributes, when iterated over breweries_array
    end
end



brewery.rb:
class Brewery
    -model object
    attr_accessor :name, :brewery_type, :street, :city, :state, :postal_code, :country, :phone, :website_url
        - creating setters & getters for each property I'm getting from API call

    @@all = []
        - a way to save each brewery object made

    def initialize(attributes_hash)
         - initializing using mass asssignment
        attributes_hash.each {|key, value| self.send("#{key}=", value) if self.respond_to?("#{key}=")}
            - if key exists, create it and set the value to it
            - since hash gives more attributes than we want to use in app, ignore attributes w/o setters & getters
            - use send method to create instance variables, keys, and their values
                - shorter than doing this (also a hassle with more properties than this):
                    def initialize(name, brewery_type, street, city, state, postal_code, country, phone, website_url)
                        @name = name

    def save

    def self.find_brewery(brewery_name)
        self.all.find {|brewery| brewery.name.downcase == brewery_name || brewery.name == brewery_name} 
            - iterate over brewery array, find brewery with name attribute that matches brewery name passed into this method
