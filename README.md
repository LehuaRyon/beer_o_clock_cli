# BeerOClockCli

Welcome to the Beer O'Clock Gem! This gem was developed for the Phase 1 CLI Project of the Online Part-Time Software Engineering course at Flatiron School.  I developed this gem to let users sift through a list of various breweries in the United States, using information from an API, and pick one or more breweries of their liking to find out more details about them. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beer_o_clock_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beer_o_clock_cli

To run the CLI:
    
    $ ruby bin/run

## Usage

Once you execute the bin file './bin/run', you will be prompted to enter your name or exit the application. Once you enter your name, you can enter the corresponding number to list locations of various breweries in the United States or exit.  If you choose to see a list a breweries, you can type in the brewery name to bring up details about that specific brewery.  After viewing those details, you have the option to see the brewery list again in order to view another brewery's details or exit using the same corresponding numbers from before.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
